            "content": "3.18: Undecidable Problems . The Jupyter notebook for this lesson can be found here: [link to notebook]. . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A __ is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An __ problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . content down here fore Evan . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer. However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): if type(n) == int: return True else: return False while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . Delete the parentheses later below. . There is __ to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether this code can run forever or not. . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltCheck. | In the above code, the code __, so HaltCheck returns an output of &quot;no end&quot;. | Then, we add another machine which | . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. . Homework/Hacks: . Use the Jupyter notebook to write an algorithm that solves a decidable problem. You can use math or whatever else you would like to do. | Write code to get the computer to run forever. Check this example if you need help, but please come up with your own idea. |",
