    "Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important.\n",

    "### Decision Problem\n",
    ">A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs: \"yes\" or \"no\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over:\n",

    "**Decidable Problems**\n",
    ">A decidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Undecidable Problems**\n",
    ">An undecidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "The Halting problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important things to note**:\n",
    "- It is important to emphasize that not all problems that are difficult to solve are undecidable. Some problems may be difficult because they require a lot of time or computing power to solve, but they are still decidable.\n",
    "- It is also important to note that some problems that are undecidable for a computer may be decidable for a human. For example, the halting problem is undecidable for a computer, but a human can often tell whether a program will halt by looking at the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework/Hacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the Jupyter notebook to write an algorithm that solves a decidable problem.\n",
    "2. Give an example of an undecidable problem and explain why it is undecidable.\n",
